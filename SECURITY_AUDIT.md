# ALX Polly Security Audit Report

## Authentication System Vulnerabilities

This document outlines security vulnerabilities identified in the ALX Polly authentication system, their potential impacts, and implemented fixes.

### 1. Exposed API Keys in Version Control

**Vulnerability**: The Supabase API keys are committed to version control in the `.env.local` file.

**Impact**: 
- Unauthorized access to the Supabase project
- Potential data breaches
- Ability for attackers to impersonate the application

**Fix**: 
- Remove API keys from version control
- Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore`
- Rotate compromised API keys
- Use environment variables in deployment environments

### 2. Missing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Vulnerability**: The admin page (`app/(dashboard)/admin/page.tsx`) lacks proper role verification. Any authenticated user can access admin functionality.

**Impact**:
- Unauthorized users can access administrative features
- Potential for data manipulation and deletion by non-admin users
- Violation of principle of least privilege

**Fix**:
- Implement role checking in the admin page
- Add role verification in middleware for admin routes
- Store user roles in the database and verify them server-side

### 3. Insecure JWT Secret Configuration

**Vulnerability**: The JWT secret in `schema.sql` is set to a placeholder value (`'your-jwt-secret'`).

**Impact**:
- If deployed with this placeholder, tokens could be easily forged
- Authentication bypass
- Session hijacking

**Fix**:
- Generate a strong, random JWT secret
- Store it securely in environment variables
- Update the schema to use the environment variable

### 4. Weak Password Policy

**Vulnerability**: No password strength requirements during registration.

**Impact**:
- Users may create weak, easily guessable passwords
- Increased vulnerability to brute force attacks
- Higher risk of account compromise

**Fix**:
- Implement password strength validation
- Require minimum length, complexity, and prevent common passwords
- Add client and server-side validation

### 5. Debug Logging in Production

**Vulnerability**: Authentication context contains console.log statements that may expose sensitive information in production.

**Impact**:
- Potential exposure of sensitive authentication data in browser console
- Information leakage that could aid attackers

**Fix**:
- Remove or disable console.log statements in production builds
- Implement proper logging levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Ensure sensitive data is never logged

### 6. Missing CSRF Protection

**Vulnerability**: No explicit CSRF tokens in authentication forms.

**Impact**:
- Potential for Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks
- Attackers could trick users into performing unwanted actions

**Fix**:
- Rely on Supabase's built-in CSRF protection
- Ensure all state-changing operations use proper POST requests
- Implement SameSite cookie attributes

## Implementation Status

- [x] Removed debug logging from auth-context.tsx
- [x] Implemented admin role verification
- [x] Added password strength validation
- [x] Secured JWT secret configuration
- [x] Protected API keys in environment variables
- [x] Added CSRF protection with SameSite cookie attributes

## Business Logic Security Audit

This section covers the security audit of the business logic in the ALX Polly application, focusing on poll creation, management, and voting mechanisms.

### Identified Vulnerabilities

#### 1. Mock Implementation in Production Code

**Vulnerability**: The poll detail page (`app/(dashboard)/polls/[id]/page.tsx`) uses mock data instead of fetching real poll data from the database.

**Impact**: 
- Users cannot see actual poll data or submit real votes
- Potential for data inconsistency and security issues when transitioning to real implementation

**Fix**: Replace mock implementation with actual data fetching and vote submission using the existing server actions.

#### 2. Lack of Vote Validation

**Vulnerability**: The `submitVote` function in `poll-actions.ts` does not validate if a user has already voted on a poll.

**Impact**: 
- Users can vote multiple times on the same poll
- Poll results can be manipulated easily

**Fix**: Implement vote validation using the existing `has_user_voted` database function before allowing a new vote.

#### 3. Insufficient Poll Ownership Verification

**Vulnerability**: While poll updates have ownership verification, the poll detail page does not verify ownership before showing edit/delete options.

**Impact**: 
- UI shows edit/delete options for polls that users don't own
- Potential confusion and failed operations when users attempt to edit polls they don't own

**Fix**: Implement proper ownership verification in the poll detail page UI.

#### 4. Anonymous Voting Without Rate Limiting

**Vulnerability**: The `submitVote` function allows anonymous voting (user_id can be null) without any rate limiting or IP tracking.

**Impact**: 
- Potential for vote manipulation through automated scripts
- No way to prevent multiple votes from the same anonymous user

**Fix**: Implement rate limiting for anonymous votes based on IP address or session tokens.

#### 5. Lack of Input Sanitization

**Vulnerability**: Poll questions and options are not properly sanitized before storage.

**Impact**: 
- Potential for XSS attacks if poll content is rendered without proper escaping
- Potential for injection attacks

**Fix**: Implement proper input sanitization for all user-provided content.

#### 6. Insecure Social Sharing Implementation

**Vulnerability**: The `vulnerable-share.tsx` component directly uses user-provided poll titles in social sharing links without proper validation or encoding.

**Impact**: 
- Potential for XSS attacks through maliciously crafted poll titles
- Potential for URL injection attacks in social sharing links

**Fix**: Implement proper encoding of all user-provided content used in URLs and ensure validation of poll titles before using them in sharing functions.

### Implementation Status

- [ ] Replace mock implementation with real poll data fetching and voting
- [ ] Implement vote validation to prevent multiple votes
- [ ] Add proper poll ownership verification in UI
- [ ] Add rate limiting for anonymous voting
- [ ] Implement input sanitization for poll content
- [ ] Fix insecure social sharing implementation

## Summary of Changes

1. **Removed Debug Logging**
   - Eliminated console.log statements from auth-context.tsx to prevent sensitive information exposure

2. **Implemented Admin Role Verification**
   - Added 'role' field to profiles table in database schema
   - Added role checking in admin page to restrict access to authorized users
   - Implemented UI feedback for unauthorized access attempts

3. **Added Password Strength Validation**
   - Implemented client-side password validation with requirements for:
     - Minimum 8 characters
     - At least one uppercase letter
     - At least one lowercase letter
     - At least one number
     - At least one special character
   - Added visual password strength indicator

4. **Secured JWT Secret Configuration**
