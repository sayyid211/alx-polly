# ALX Polly Security Audit Report

## Authentication System Vulnerabilities

This document outlines security vulnerabilities identified in the ALX Polly authentication system, their potential impacts, and implemented fixes.

### 1. Exposed API Keys in Version Control

**Vulnerability**: The Supabase API keys are committed to version control in the `.env.local` file.

**Impact**: 
- Unauthorized access to the Supabase project
- Potential data breaches
- Ability for attackers to impersonate the application

**Fix**: 
- Remove API keys from version control
- Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore`
- Rotate compromised API keys
- Use environment variables in deployment environments

### 2. Missing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Vulnerability**: The admin page (`app/(dashboard)/admin/page.tsx`) lacks proper role verification. Any authenticated user can access admin functionality.

**Impact**:
- Unauthorized users can access administrative features
- Potential for data manipulation and deletion by non-admin users
- Violation of principle of least privilege

**Fix**:
- Implement role checking in the admin page
- Add role verification in middleware for admin routes
- Store user roles in the database and verify them server-side

### 3. Insecure JWT Secret Configuration

**Vulnerability**: The JWT secret in `schema.sql` is set to a placeholder value (`'your-jwt-secret'`).

**Impact**:
- If deployed with this placeholder, tokens could be easily forged
- Authentication bypass
- Session hijacking

**Fix**:
- Generate a strong, random JWT secret
- Store it securely in environment variables
- Update the schema to use the environment variable

### 4. Weak Password Policy

**Vulnerability**: No password strength requirements during registration.

**Impact**:
- Users may create weak, easily guessable passwords
- Increased vulnerability to brute force attacks
- Higher risk of account compromise

**Fix**:
- Implement password strength validation
- Require minimum length, complexity, and prevent common passwords
- Add client and server-side validation

### 5. Debug Logging in Production

**Vulnerability**: Authentication context contains console.log statements that may expose sensitive information in production.

**Impact**:
- Potential exposure of sensitive authentication data in browser console
- Information leakage that could aid attackers

**Fix**:
- Remove or disable console.log statements in production builds
- Implement proper logging levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Ensure sensitive data is never logged

### 6. Missing CSRF Protection

**Vulnerability**: No explicit CSRF tokens in authentication forms.

**Impact**:
- Potential for Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks
- Attackers could trick users into performing unwanted actions

**Fix**:
- Rely on Supabase's built-in CSRF protection
- Ensure all state-changing operations use proper POST requests
- Implement SameSite cookie attributes

## Implementation Status

- [x] Removed debug logging from auth-context.tsx
- [x] Implemented admin role verification
- [x] Added password strength validation
- [x] Secured JWT secret configuration
- [x] Protected API keys in environment variables
- [x] Added CSRF protection with SameSite cookie attributes

## Summary of Changes

1. **Removed Debug Logging**
   - Eliminated console.log statements from auth-context.tsx to prevent sensitive information exposure

2. **Implemented Admin Role Verification**
   - Added 'role' field to profiles table in database schema
   - Added role checking in admin page to restrict access to authorized users
   - Implemented UI feedback for unauthorized access attempts

3. **Added Password Strength Validation**
   - Implemented client-side password validation with requirements for:
     - Minimum 8 characters
     - At least one uppercase letter
     - At least one lowercase letter
     - At least one number
     - At least one special character
   - Added visual password strength indicator

4. **Secured JWT Secret Configuration**
   - Updated schema.sql to use environment variable for JWT secret
   - Added JWT_SECRET to .env.local file

5. **Protected API Keys**
   - Replaced hardcoded API keys with placeholder values in .env.local
   - Added .env.local to .gitignore to prevent committing secrets

6. **Added CSRF Protection**
   - Implemented SameSite=Lax cookie attribute in middleware
   - Added Secure flag for production environments
   - Ensured HttpOnly flag is set on authentication cookies
